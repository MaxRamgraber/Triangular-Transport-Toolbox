# Triangular Transport Toolbox

This repository contains the triangular transport map Python class. To use this class, download the file `transport_map.py`, copy it into your working directory, import the class into your Python code with `from transport_map import *`. Examples for the use of the triangular transport toolbox are provided in:

 - **Example A - spiral distribution** illustrates the basic use of the map, from the parameterization of a transport map object to its use for forward mapping, inverse mapping, and conditional sampling.
 - **Example B - statistical inference** builds on previous established basics to illustrate the use of transport methods for statistical inference. The first examples examines statistical dependencies between temperatures in two cities, the second demonstrates Bayesian parameter inference in a small Monod kinetics example.
